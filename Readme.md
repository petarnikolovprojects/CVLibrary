# Image processing and Computer Vision library + GUI
***
</br>


## Project Description
A small library for image processing and computer vision algorithms having two versions - written in C + Qt and C# + WPF.
The C version was written in 2013.
The library is used in personal projects with the goal of learning algorithms basics and developing from scratch.

## What's inside
_A list of some of the included algorithms:_
- Copy ROI
- Crop Image
- Mask operations
- Normalize image
- Convolution
- Histogram calculation and drawing
- Histogram analysis
- Emboss effect
- Blend effect
- Cartoon effect
- Sepia effect
- Rotate image using Cubic interpolation
- Image Scaling
- Affine transforms - rotation, translation
- Morphological operations - dilate, erode, closing, opening
- Color space conversiotions for Binary, Grayscale, BGR, HSL, XYZ, UV, Lab
- Calculating color temperature
- Image sharpening
- Image blur - gaussian, median, around point, by columns/rows only
- Difference of Gaussians
- Substract images
- Color invert
- Edge extraction - Prewitt, Laplace, Sobel, Gradient
- Calculating magnitude of gradient of an image
- White balance - 4 algorithms
- Brightness and contrast correction
- Noise correction
- Gamma correction
- Fourier transform and Spatial to frequency domain convertion

_GUI options:_
- Working with layers - adding new, removing, splitting and combining layers
- Customizable list of buttons - for accessing all library's features
- Drawing, selecting with mouse
- Saving images in different formats and quality
- Applying convolutional 7x7 filter to achieve different effects
- Using C# Reflection method to write image processing function in the GUI
